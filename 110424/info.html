    <h2>freakybob.site is a website that was created by <a href="https://github.com/5quirre1" id="squirre1">5quirre1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wish13yt" id="wish">wish13yt</a>. This all started from Wish mentioning a "freakybob" domain. Everyone was looking at domains until Squirrel found a domain on a domain website. The domain was "freakybob.site" for $4.00. Squirrel bought it almost instantly starting the well deserved birth of freakybob.site!</h2>

<strong><h3>Can this website get taken down by Viacom, Nickolodeon or Nintendo?</h3></strong>

<p id="para4">We are not using any copyrighted music, images, or videos (YouTube embeds) in this website. The only music you hear throughout the website is copyright free music and Nintendo Wii U music from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/wiiumusic">Internet Archive.</a> Since we are not selfhosting the music and pirating anything, Nintendo should not be able to take down the website, BUT if anything were to happen, We would be cooked since Nintendo is money hungry.</p>
